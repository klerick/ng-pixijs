This library provides powerful tools for integrating [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) - a popular library for 2D graphics and animationsâ€”into [Angular](https://angular.dev/) applications. 
By utilizing a custom [RendererFactory2](https://angular.dev/api/core/RendererFactory2), developers can seamlessly combine the robust visual capabilities of PixiJS with the flexibility and structure of Angular.

#### Key Features

1. PixiJS Integration in Angular:
  - Enables the use of standard primitives and features of PixiJS within an Angular application, ensuring smooth integration and interaction between the two frameworks.

2. Custom RendererFactory2:
  - Implements a custom RendererFactory2 that manages the rendering of the PixiJS scene. This allows developers to use PixiJS for creating complex graphics and animations while staying within the Angular ecosystem.

3. Creation of Custom Components:
  - Provides the ability to define custom Angular components that act as wrappers for PixiJS objects. This allows using Angular's component and template approach to manage graphics.

4. Support for Dependency Injection (DI):
  - Full support for Angular DI within components, simplifying state management and interactions between components based on PixiJS.

5. Control Flow in Templates:
  - Support for Angular control flow directives in templates, enabling the use of constructs like *ngIf, *ngFor, and others for dynamically managing elements in the PixiJS scene.

#### Benefits

- Powerful Visual Capabilities: Leverage PixiJS's full potential for high-performance 2D graphics and animations, providing seamless integration with Angular.
- Angular Flexibility: Use Angular components, DI, and templates to manage complex graphical applications.
- Simplified Management: Manage state and interactions between components through Angular DI, simplifying development and maintenance of applications.

#### Applications

- Games and Animations: Develop games and animations that require high-performance graphics.
- Interactive Applications: Create interactive applications with dynamic graphics and animations.
- Data Visualization: Utilize PixiJS capabilities to create data visualizations within Angular applications.

This library provides a powerful and flexible foundation for developing applications that require high-performance 2D graphics and animations, integrating the capabilities of PixiJS with Angular's architecture.
